# blackhole

Blackhole is a mental health feature that provides the user for them to text their negative thoughts or any unwanted emotions that they are experiencing.
Once they are done writing what they feel, they can press the ‘let it go’ button and
the text is erased. This provides students with a safe outlet for them to channel
their emotions -and be aware of what they are. It also physically allows students to
let go of the negativity or bad thoughts they may carry. 
And, if there is any sensetive message, such as user showing potential to suicide, it will pop a message suggesting to call emergency contact or professionalist for help.
